                        Tubach 1995–6). Although it is likely that individual Christians travelling
                        along the Silk Road reached China before the 7th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, there is little
                        evidence to support the historicity of the tradition reported by ʿAbdishoʿ

                        erection of a metropolitan see for China. ʿAbdishoʿ himself gives the credit
                        to Ṣliba Zka (714–28), while Ishoʿyahb (probably  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ishoyahb-III-of-Adiabene">

                     <p>The history of Christianity in China as recorded in the so-called  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Xian">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Xi’an</span>
                        </a>
                        Stele (erected in 781) and other Chinese documents begins with the arrival
                        of the missionary Aluoben in Chang’an (present-day Xi’an) in 635 and his
                        reception by Emperor Taizong (626–49). The Stele goes on to tell us of the
                        progress of Christianity in China under the protection of the successive
                        emperors. Like the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Thomas-Christians">Thomas
                            Christians</a>  in India, the Syriac Christians in China were subject
                        to bishops sent to them from their mother Church in the West. If the term
                             <span class="tei-hi"><i>dade</i></span>  used in the Stele is equivalent to ‘bishop’
                        (or ‘metropolitan’), these bishops will include, besides Aluoben, Jilie
                        (Gabriel) in the first half of  <span class="tei-corr">the </span>8th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, Jihe (Giwargis or Gigoy?), who
                        arrived in 744, and Yaolun (Yoḥannan), who was  <span class="tei-hi"><i>dade</i></span>
                        and  <span class="tei-hi"><i>apesqopā</i></span>  at the time of the erection of the
                        Stele.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Chinese records from the early Tang period refer to Christianity as the
                        religion of Persia (Bosi) and, after 745, as that of the Roman (or
                        Byzantine) Empire (<span class="tei-hi"><i>Da Qin</i></span>), while the Christians
                        themselves called their religion  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Jingjiao</i></span>, or the
                        ‘luminous religion’. The Persian term  <span class="tei-hi"><i>tarsā</i></span>  was also
                        sometimes used of Christians in China and appears in the form  <span class="tei-hi"><i>dasuo</i></span>  in the Xi’an Stele. Although there is evidence
                        for the existence of a number of Christian communities outside Chang’an, the
                        passage of the Stele telling us that monasteries were built in every
                        ‘prefecture’ of the land (of which there were approximately 360) during the
                        reign of Gaozong (650–83) is clearly exaggerated. It is likely that
                        Christians, like the Manicheans and Zoroastrians who also entered China
                        along the Silk Road in the middle of the first millennium, remained a small
                        minority and, consisting mainly of peoples of Iranian origin (Persians and
                        Sogdians), were generally regarded as a ‘foreign’ element within the Chinese
                        population.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The decline of  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Jingjiao</i></span>  in the 9th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  is no doubt
                        to be attributed to increasing political instability and difficulty of
                        travel along the Silk Road. Emperor Wuzong’s edict of 845 proscribing
                        ‘foreign’ religions, though aimed primarily at Buddhists, evidently had a
                        devastating effect on Christianity, as well as on Manichaeism and
                        Zoroastrianism, in China. Little is heard of the Christians in China after
                        845, although the mention in an Arabic source of ‘Christians’, along with
                        Muslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians, among the groups massacred in Guanzhou
                        (Canton) during the rebellion of Huang Chao in 878/9 has been interpreted as
                        indicating their survival for a period in southern China, while the wording
                        of the colophon of the  <abbr>ms.</abbr>  containing the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Sanwei mengdu
                            zan</i></span>  and  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Zun jing</i></span>  (nos. 3 and 4 below) has
                        been understood to indicate that it was copied after the fall of the Tang
                        Dynasty in 907, suggesting the survival of Christian communities using
                        Chinese after that date.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Besides in the Xi’an Stele (properly, the ‘Monument on the propagation of the
                        Religion of the Light of Da Qin in China’,  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Da Qin Jingjiao

                        of documents discovered in the early 20th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  in Dunhuang. The so-called
                        Dunhuang Christian documents comprise: 1.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Xuting Mishisuo
                            jing</i></span>  (‘Book of Jesus-Messiah’ or ‘Book of listening to the
                        Messiah’; Takakusu  <abbr>ms.</abbr>); 2.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Yishen lun</i></span>  (‘Discourse on
                        the One God’, consisting of three disparate treatises; Tomioka  <abbr>ms.</abbr>); 3.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Da Qin Jingjiao Sanwei mengdu zan</i></span>  (‘Hymn in adoration
                        of the Holy Trinity’); 4.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Zun jing</i></span>  (‘Book of honor’
                        or [list of] ‘Venerable books’); 5.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Zhi xuan anle
                            jing</i></span>  (‘Book on attaining profound peace and joy’); 6a. Beginning of
                             <span class="tei-hi"><i>Da Qin Jingjiao Xuan yuan zhiben jing</i></span>  (‘Book of
                        proclamation of the highest origin of origins’); 6b. End of  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Da Qin Jingjiao Xuan yuan zhiben jing</i></span>  (Kojima  <abbr>ms.</abbr>  B);
                        7.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Da Qin Jingjiao Dasheng tongzhen guifa zan</i></span>  (‘Hymn
                        of praise for the Transfiguration of Our Lord’; Kojima  <abbr>ms.</abbr>  A). Of these, no.
                        3 is a paraphrase of the Great Doxology (<span class="tei-corr">i.e., </span>the equivalent of the Latin
                             <span class="tei-hi"><i>Gloria [in excelsis Deo]</i></span>); the remaining texts,
                        though clearly Christian in content, appear to be original compositions and
                        have no known counterparts in Syriac. No. 6b is now known to be a modern
                        forgery, and the same is most likely to be the case with no. 7. Nos. 1 and 2
                        have been associated by scholars with the missionary activity of Aluoben. It
                        has been suggested that the manuscripts we have today of these two texts too
                        are modern forgeries, though based on genuine Tang-Dynasty documents (see
                        Lin 2006). The remaining texts have been judged to date from a later period;
                        nos.  3, 5, and 6 may have been composed by Jingjing, who was responsible
                        also for the text of the Xi’an Stele. An important new addition was made to
                        this corpus in 2006 with the discovery in Luoyang, the ‘eastern capital’ of
                        the Tang Dynasty, of a stone pillar, which was erected by a family evidently
                        of Sogdian origin in 814/5 and which, though missing its lower part, is
                        inscribed with a more complete text of no. 6 than is found in the Dunhuang
                        manuscript (see Ge 2009 and Tang 2009).

                     <p>After the turn of the millennium, the presence of Syriac Christians in China
                        becomes perceptible again during the 12th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  with the movement into
                        northern China of those Turkic tribes that counted E.-Syr. converts among
                        their members, and reached a new peak during the period of the Yuan Dynasty
                        (1271–1368), whose Mongol rulers were in close marital and political
                        alliances with Turco-Mongol tribal federations with strong Christian
                        elements, such as the Kerait and the Öngüt. The open religious policy of
                        Genghis Khan and his heirs, the expansion of their empire to the far western
                        parts of Eurasia, and the resulting facilitation of east-west travel both by
                        land and by sea led to the arrival also of non-Syriac Christians in China,
                        including Latin missionaries and traders, as well as Armenians, Alans, and
                        Georgians. The term  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Yelikewen</i></span>  (Turkic/Mongolian  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Erke’ün</i></span>), whose etymology remains unclear, was used
                        to refer to Christians of all these denominations in the Chinese records
                        from this period.

                     <p>We learn from the ‘History of Mar Yahbalaha’ that there was a  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>
                        metropolitan in Khan Baliq (Dadu, modern Beijing), which Khubilai Khan
                        officially made his capital in 1272, by the middle of the 13th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, and it
                        was from Khan Baliq that  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Sawma-Rabban">

                        the Christian population of Yuan China evidently consisted largely of
                        ‘foreign’, non-Han, elements, usually of Turkic origin. Official and
                        semi-official Chinese sources, accounts left by members of Latin mendicant
                        orders and by Marco Polo, and archaeological evidence, including a large
                        number of crosses and funerary inscriptions, sometimes written in Syriac and
                        more often in Turkic in Syriac script (see  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Inscriptions">Inscriptions</a>,
                        ‘Central and East Asia’), testify to the presence of Syriac Christians,
                        besides in cities along the Silk Road, especially in Inner Mongolia and in
                        the southern port city of Quanzhou (Zaitun), as well as in the area around
                        Beijing and in commercial centers around the lower reaches of the Changjiang
                        (Yangtze River), such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou.

                     <p>The history of Syriac Christianity in China more or less came to a close with

                        although the possible survival of some descendants of these Christians into
