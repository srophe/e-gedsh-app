                     <p>Syriac-speaking Christians, like Christians and Jews of every generation,
                        have employed various exegetical strategies for interpreting their biblical
                        canon. Their exegetical literature includes not only prose commentaries but
                        also hymns, verse homilies, dialogue poems, treatises, commentaries on the
                        lectionary cycle of biblical readings, and the Syriac versions of the  <abbr>NT</abbr>.
                        The astute biblical insights of early writers, such as  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ephrem">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Ephrem</span>
                        </a>  and  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Serugh">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Yaʿqub of Serugh</span>
                        </a>, were extolled by subsequent authors who
                        recycled their ideas in later prose commentaries. Since most Syriac authors
                        were rarely explicit about their hermeneutical approach, their methods for
                        interpreting the Bible are uncovered by studying their works.
                     </p>
                     <span class="tei-label">Early Syriac Literature</span>
                     
                     <p>The history of the reception of the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  in the Syriac-speaking world begins
                        with the Syriac translations of the Greek text of the Gospels. These
                        translations introduced (or perhaps preserved) interpretations of the
                        Gospels that are no longer found (or were never found) in the Greek text.
                        For example,  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Tatian">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Tatian</span>
                        </a>’s  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diatessaron">Diatessaron</a>  (2nd  <abbr>cent.</abbr>) reports that John the Baptist (Mark 1:6) consumed milk and honey
                        (not locusts and wild honey), which links his diet to the foods of the
                        Promised Land (Deut. 6:3). The Old Syriac Gospels (<span class="tei-hi"><i>Ewangelion da-mparrše</i></span>), also known as the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Vetus
                            Syra</i></span>, report that Barabbas was imprisoned for murder and  <span class="tei-hi"><i>heresy </i></span>(Luke 23:25 [Curetonian]), a reading that may
                        allude to the theological controversies at the time of this translation.
                        Much of early Christian Syriac literature, though not explicitly exegetical,
                        is in dialogue with the  <abbr>NT</abbr>. The elusive  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Solomon-Odes-of">Odes of
                            Solomon</a>  (2nd  <abbr>cent.</abbr>), a group of 42 liturgical poems (a few of which
                        are also known in Greek and Coptic), show traces of early interpretations of
                        the  <abbr>NT</abbr>, such as the extended meditation on the virgin birth of Jesus in Ode
                        19. In the ‘<a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Thomas-Acts-of">Acts of
                            Thomas</a>’ (3rd  <abbr>cent.</abbr>), the apostle Thomas sprinkles his farewell
                        discourse with phrases from the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  allowing scholars to observe how these  <abbr>NT</abbr>
                        verses were interpreted in early Syriac Christianity. Particularly important
                        for the author of the ‘Acts of Thomas’ were passages that promoted an
                        encratic lifestyle such as Matt. 5:3 and 5 (ch. 94), 6:34 (ch. 28), and
                        11:29 (ch. 28 and 86).
                     </p>
                     <span class="tei-label">Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem</span>
                     
                     <p>
                         <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aphrahat">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Aphrahaṭ</span>
                        </a>, who called himself a ‘student of Holy Scriptures’
                        (Dem.22, §26), composed twenty-three ‘Demonstrations’ (337–45) that rely
                        heavily on the Bible (he cites the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  approximately 700 times). Reading the
                        Bible as an integral book, he illustrates its integrity through numerous
                        ‘exemplary sequences’ (Murray 1977) in which characters from the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  find
                        their precursors in the  <abbr>OT</abbr>. He can focus on particular passages, as in the
                        Fifth Demonstration (‘On Wars’), which is an exegesis of Dan. 2, 7, and 8.
                        His exegesis is driven by a concern for practical questions of Christian
                        life, such as prayer, fasting, humility, and the relations between Jews and
                        Christians. For this reason, he exhorts his audience to put biblical
                        precepts into practice: ‘My friends, it is not sufficient that we learn to
                        read the books of God [<span class="tei-corr">i.e., </span>the Bible], rather, we must do them!’ (Dem. 14,
                        §32).
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The first running Syriac commentary is Ephrem’s ‘Commentary on the
                        Diatessaron’ (4th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>), most of which survives in Syriac. He also wrote
                        commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles and Paul’s letters (surviving in
                        Armenian). Like most Syriac commentators, Ephrem does not remark on every
                        verse, rather, employing a close reading of the text, he explains difficult
                        verses and unravels conundrums. He distinguishes between the factual (or
                        historical) and spiritual interpretations. The former focuses on the details
                        in the biblical passage, the persons involved, and their historical
                        circumstances, while the latter seeks to uncover the eternal truths within
                        the text (Brock 2006). Aphrahaṭ (Dem. 5, §25 and Dem. 22, §26) and Ephrem
                        (Comm. Diat.<span class="tei-hi"><i>,</i></span>ch 1,18–9) would agree that while the
                        factual interpretation of the Bible is essential, the sacred text permits
                        innumerable spiritual interpretations. Ephrem can use his exegesis to engage
                        in polemics against his adversaries such as the Marcionites, the followers
                        of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mani">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Mani</span>
                        </a>,
                        and those he calls Arians in order to defend Nicene orthodoxy
                        (Shepardson).
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Like Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem interprets the Bible as an integral text: comparing and
                        contrasting different scenes of the Bible, especially between the Old and
                        New Testaments. Events in the  <abbr>OT</abbr>  prefigure (*<span class="tei-hi"><i>ṣwr</i></span>  and
                            *<span class="tei-hi"><i>rmz</i></span>)  <abbr>NT</abbr>  events and terms such as  <span class="tei-hi"><i>rāzā</i></span>  ‘symbol’ or ‘mystery’, and  <span class="tei-hi"><i>ṭupsā</i></span>  ‘type’ are used to penetrate the meaning of such events.
                        These  <span class="tei-hi"><i>rāze</i></span>, or ‘mysteries’, are not enigmas or
                        inscrutable quandaries; the term  <span class="tei-hi"><i>rāzā</i></span>  is already
                        found in Dan. 2:17–9 which reports that Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, along with
                        its meaning, was a  <span class="tei-hi"><i>rāzā</i></span>, the significance of which
                        could only be revealed by God. The  <span class="tei-hi"><i>rāze</i></span>  drawn from
                        nature prompt the believer to contemplate the divine. Thus, Ephrem teaches
                        his audience how the natural characteristics of the olive tree illuminate
                        the mystery of Christ (<span class="tei-hi"><i>rāz mšiḥā</i></span>; Comm. Diat.<span class="tei-hi"><i>,</i></span>  ch. 21,11).

                        </a>  (d. 428), had been translated into Syriac. Theodore
                        opposed the allegorical interpretation of the Alexandrian school in favor of
                        a literal sense that takes into account the historicity of the passage and
                        places less emphasis on the Christological interpretation of the  <abbr>OT</abbr>  (his
                        ‘Commentary on the Gospel of John’ survives in Syriac). When emperor Zeno
                        closed the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa-School-of">School of
                            Edessa</a>  for its adherence to Theodore’s theology (489), the school
                        was reestablished at  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Nisibis">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Nisibis</span>
                        </a>, just
                        inside the Persian border, under the direction of Narsai (d.  <abbr>ca.</abbr>  500). The
                        establishment of this school would lead to distinct E.- and W.-Syr.
                        exegetical traditions. Narsai wrote over three hundred verse homilies (<span class="tei-hi"><i>memre</i></span>) in many of which he recast particular biblical
                        passages, including several Gospel parables, with dramatic style. His
                        exegesis has much in common with Theodore’s: events in the  <abbr>OT</abbr>  must be seen
                        in their context before they are considered as types for  <abbr>NT</abbr>  events.

                        </a>  in the
                        dyophysite Christology with Narsai, resisted Antiochene exegesis and the
                        Chalcedonian formula. Like Narsai, he composed verse homilies (<span class="tei-hi"><i>memre</i></span>) in metered couplets of 7 + 7 or 12 + 12 on
                        biblical topics. He engaged the Bible with a close reading in which he
                        explored the meaning of a single verse or word in relationship to other
                        passages from the entire biblical canon (similar to Ephrem). Thus, when
                        David selects rocks to sling at Goliath (1 Sam. 17:40), Yaʿqub sees the rock
                        as Christ, a reference to 1 Cor. 10:4 in which Paul alludes to Ex. 17:6 and
                        Num. 20:7–13 (David and Goliath;  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Memrā</i></span>  34). This
                        complex interrelationship among four biblical verses illustrates how, for
                        Yaʿqub, the Bible, an integral text, is best interpreted through an
                        intertextual, typological approach.

                        of questions and answers (a format well-known in E.-Syr. exegesis; Griffith
                        1982, 59) on individual or collections of biblical books. The  <abbr>NT</abbr>  chapters
                        discuss the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and difficult passages in
                        Paul’s Letters. His hermeneutical approach is explicitly typological: words
                        and events in the  <abbr>OT</abbr>  are types and allegories for Christ’s salvific role in
                        the  <abbr>NT</abbr>. His exegesis seeks to defend the doctrines that were of interest to
                        Theodore of Mopsuestia and the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, though he also

                     <p>The W.-Syr. tradition steered closer to the exegetical approach of
                        Alexandrian exegetes, the Cappadocians, and John Chrysostom. A contemporary
                        of Yaʿqub of Serugh,  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Philoxenos-of-Mabbug">

                            of Mabbug</span>
                        </a>  (d. 523) wrote Gospel commentaries (surviving in
                        fragments). Because he viewed the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Peshitta">Peshitta</a>  as
                        unsatisfactory for theological argumentation, he initiated a new translation
                        of the Greek  <abbr>NT</abbr>  into Syriac (known as the Philoxenian version of which only
                        fragments survive) that included the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation.
                        His commentaries, in which he focuses on the plain sense and context of a
                        passage, are closer to polemical homilies than to a verse-by-verse exegesis
                        (McCullough, 19–21). Much of the works of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mushe-bar-Kipho">

                        though his commentaries on John, Luke and Acts along with part of the

                        of Merv (McCullough, 83). Finally, in 1277 the polymath  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bar-Ebroyo-Grigorios">

                        Syriac exegetical tradition to quote Ephrem, Yaʿqub of Serugh, Philoxenos,
                        and even the E.-Syr. writer Ishoʿdad of Merv, though he was largely
                        dependent on Dionysios bar Ṣalibi.

                     <span class="tei-label">Conclusion</span>
                     
                     <p>The Bible has held a central place in Syriac literature as this brief history
                        of the reception of the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  demonstrates. Early Syriac writers such as
                        Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem, and Yaʿqub of Serugh knew the Bible well, having committed
                        much of it to memory, and their writings witness to a close reading of it.
                        They focused on the factual or historical sense of a passage and then
                        perceived the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>rāze</i></span>  ‘mysteries’ within it that could
                        give rise to spiritual interpretations. Syriac exegesis came under the
                        increasing influence of the Greek Fathers. A century and a half after
                        Ephrem, Philoxenos of Mabbug insisted on a new translation of the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  that
                        was closer to the Greek. A century after that  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Tumo-of-Harqel">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Tumo of

                        </a>  revised the Philoxenian version (AD 616) mirroring the
                        Greek text in Syriac at the expense of good Syriac idiom. But even as more
                        Greek authors were translated into Syriac, later Syriac writers continued to
                        revere the works of their cultural ancestors, such as Ephrem and Yaʿqub of
                        Serugh, reprising their exegetical insights for successive generations
                        including our own.
