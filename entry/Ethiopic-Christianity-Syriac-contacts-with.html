                     <p>Christianity reached the Kingdom of Aksum, on the northern edge of the great
                        Ethiopian plateau, by the reign of ʿĒzānā in the middle of the 4th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        According to Rufinus (4th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>), the introduction of Christianity was
                        facilitated by a certain Frumentius from Tyre (later known in the Ethiopic
                        tradition as Salāmā Kaśātē Berhān), who was ordained  <abbr>bp.</abbr>  of ‘India’ (<span class="tei-corr">i.e.,</span>
                        Ethiopia) by  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Athanasius-of-Alexandria">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Athanasius of Alexandria</span>
                        </a>. In the 6th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, the traveler Cosmas
                        Indicopleustes reported that there were a large number of churches in
                        Ethiopia as well as numerous bishops, martyrs, and monks. In time, Ethiopic
                        Christianity became associated with the Oriental Orthodox Churches, which
                        include the Coptic, Armenian,  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Syriac-Orthodox-Church">Syriac
                            Orthodox</a>, and  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Malankara-Syriac-Orthodox-Church">Malankara Syriac Orthodox</a>  Churches, all of which accept the
                        Councils of Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, but reject the Council of
                        Chalcedon (see  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ecumenical-dialogue">Ecumenical
                            dialogue</a>). Throughout its history, Ethiopic Christianity has had
                        various contacts with Syriac Christianity. In general, the influence of
                        Ethiopic Christianity on Syriac Christianity seems to have been rather
                        limited, though it was certainly not non-existent. The influence of Syriac
                        Christianity on Ethiopic Christianity, on the other hand, was more
                        substantial. This influence can be divided into two basic time periods: the
                        Aksumite Period (4th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  –  <abbr>ca.</abbr>  900) and the Solomonic Period
                        (1270–1770).
                     </p>
                     <span class="tei-label">The Aksumite Period</span>
                     
                     <p>In the scholarly literature, a great deal of attention has been focused on
                        possible Syriac influences on Ethiopic Christianity in the Aksumite period.
                        Although Christianity reached Ethiopia in the 4th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, the spread of
                        Christianity throughout Ethiopia is traditionally attributed to the efforts
                        of a group of foreign missionaries active in the late 5th to early 6th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        These missionaries include the Ṣādeqān, Maṭāʿ, and especially the so-called
                        Nine Saints (see A. Brita, in  <span class="tei-hi"><i>
                             <abbr>EAe</abbr>
                        </i></span>, vol. 3, 1188–91).
                        A number of scholars, including I. Guidi (1888, 33–4 with n. 1; 1932, 13–5)
                        and especially C. Conti Rossini (1928, esp. 155–65), have argued that these
                        foreign missionaries originated from Syriac-speaking areas. Based on this
                        connection, a theory was developed that attributed a great deal of Syriac
                        influence to the development of Christianity in Ethiopia, including the
                        introduction of monasticism as well as the translation of the Bible into
                        Geʿez, the classical language of Ethiopic Christianity. The association of
                        these missionaries with Syriac-speaking areas was based on three principal
                        arguments, all of which have been seriously challenged in more recent
                        scholarship.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>First, it was argued that the personal names of the missionaries and the
                        geographical names from which they are said to originate are of Syriac
                        origin (Guidi 1888, 33–4 n. 1; Conti Rossini 1928, 161). More recently,
                        however, Marrassini (1990, 35–8; 1999, 326–8) has shown that few, if any, of
                        these names are actually of Syriac origin.</p>
                     
                     <p>Second, it was proposed that the transcription of Greek names in Geʿez,
                        especially in translations of the Bible, was based on the pattern of Aramaic
                        (Guidi 1888, 33–34 n. 1; Conti Rossini 1928, 156). Marrassini (1990, 39–41;
                        1999, 329–30) has, however, pointed out that this pattern is not restricted
                        to Aramaic, but rather it is the typical way in which Greek is transcribed
                        in Semitic languages.</p>
                     
                     <p>The third argument adduced in favor of Syriac influence on Ethiopic
                        Christianity in the Aksumite period involves Syriac loanwords in Geʿez. More
                        than a century ago, Th. Nöldeke drew attention to a number of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aramaic">Aramaic</a>
                        loanwords in Geʿez. Guidi (1932, 14) and especially Conti Rossini (1928,
                        155) argued that some of these Aramaic loanwords in Geʿez are more
                        specifically of Syriac origin,  <span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>Geʿez  <span class="tei-hi"><i>hāymānot</i></span>
                        ‘faith’ (often translating Greek  <span class="tei-hi"><i>pístis</i></span>) from Syriac
                             <span class="tei-hi"><i>haymānutā</i></span>. In an influential study, however,
                        Polotsky showed that several of these Aramaic loanwords were not borrowed
                        from Syriac, but rather from Jewish Aramaic,  <span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>Geʿez  <span class="tei-hi"><i>meṣwāt</i></span>  ‘alms, charity’ (no such word exists in Syriac) and Geʿez  <span class="tei-hi"><i>ṭāʿot</i></span>  ‘idol’ (Syriac has  <span class="tei-hi"><i>ṭāʿyutā</i></span>, which not only preserves the third root consonant  <span class="tei-hi"><i>y</i></span>, but means ‘error, mistake’). Further research by
                        Ullendorff (1967, 120–5), Witakowski (1989–90, 191–2; forthcoming), and
                        Marrassini (1990, 38–9; 1999, 328–9) has raised additional questions about
                        some of the purported Syriac loanwords in Geʿez while at the same time
                        suggested several new possible examples. In the current state of research,
                        it can only be conclusively stated that Geʿez contains a number of Aramaic
                        loanwords, some of which are certainly not Syriac, but others of which may
                        potentially be Syriac. Before any meaningful historical conclusions can be
                        drawn, an updated analysis of all the Aramaic loanwords in Geʿez is needed,
                        taking into account recent developments in Aramaic dialectology as well as
                        the increasingly robust methodology of contact linguistics.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In the end, the evidence for significant Syriac influence on Ethiopic
                        Christianity in the Aksumite period is rather slim. Nevertheless, it does
                        seem all but certain that there were contacts between Ethiopic Christianity
                        and Syriac Christianity at this time, especially given that the Aksumite
                        kingdom was involved in various power struggles with South Arabian kingdoms
                        in the Arabian Peninsula, a place where Syriac-speaking Christians are known
                        to have resided. In one instance of particular importance to contacts
                        between Syriac and Ethiopic Christianity, the Aksumite  <span class="tei-hi"><i>neguś</i></span>  Kālēb (<abbr>fl.</abbr>  first half of the 6th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>) intervened against

                     <p>Setting aside the problematic evidence of the Aksumite period, Syriac
                        influence on Ethiopic Christianity can be firmly established for Geʿez
                        literature from the Solomonic period. In this case, however, Syriac
                        influence was almost always mediated by Arabic Christianity, which inherited
                        a great deal from the Syriac heritage.</p>
                     
                     <p>Alongside original compositions, Geʿez literature contains a significant body
                        of translations which were made from Greek in the Aksumite period and from
                        Arabic in the Solomonic period; there is little evidence for literary
                        activity in the intervening time of the Zāg<span class="tei-hi"><sup>w</sup></span>ē
                        dynasty (900–1270). In many cases, the Arabic literature was itself
                        translated from Greek, Coptic, and Syriac. While there may be a few rare
                        cases in which Syriac literature in Geʿez was translated directly from
                        Syriac, in most cases Arabic was the bridge by which Syriac literature
                        reached Ethiopic Christianity.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The Bible is the earliest piece of literature associated with Ethiopic
                        Christianity. At least part of the Bible was already translated into Geʿez
                        by the end of the 4th to the early 5th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  as can be deduced from biblical
                        quotations in the Aksumite inscriptions (Knibb, 46–54). Though there is now
                        general consensus that the Geʿez  <abbr>OT</abbr>  and  <abbr>NT</abbr>  were both translated from Greek,
                        a number of different  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Vorlagen</i></span>, including Syriac,
                        have been proposed throughout the history of scholarship. A. Vööbus, for
                        instance, argued that the Geʿez Gospels were translated from Syriac and then
                        revised against the Greek text. It is now clear, however, that Syriac
                        influence on the Geʿez Bible occurred at a later stage (probably in the 14th
                         <abbr>cent.</abbr>) when the Geʿez biblical text was revised against a Syriac biblical
                        text or, more likely, an Arabic version of a Syriac biblical text (see
                        Knibb, in  <span class="tei-hi"><i>
                             <abbr>EAe</abbr>

                        1999). Evidence of interest in the comparison of Syriac and Ethiopic
                        biblical texts (along with Coptic, Arabic, and Armenian) is found in  <abbr>ms.</abbr>
                        Vat. Barberini Or. 2, a 15th-cent. polyglot Psalter in five languages, which
                        was owned by a  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  priest named Ṣalib (see S. P. Brock,  <span class="tei-hi"><i>The Bible in the Syriac tradition</i></span>  [2nd  <abbr>ed.</abbr>  2006],

                     <p>Moving beyond the Bible, a number of Syriac-speaking authors appear in Geʿez
                        literature. Two demonstrations by  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aphrahat">

                        the Armenian translation. In 1964, E. Cerulli published a text on the
                        resurrection of the dead, which was subsequently identified as a portion of

                        any of these are among Ephrem’s genuine writings. Several homilies
                        attributed to Ephrem are extracted in the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Hāymānota
                            ābaw</i></span>  ‘Faith of the Fathers’, which is a large compendium of
                        patristic writings, synodical statements, and canons (unedited; see A.  Wion

                        </i></span>, vol. 2, 1073–5 and Graf). In
                        addition, Ephrem is said to have composed the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Weddāsē
                            Māryām</i></span>  ‘Praise of Mary’ (<abbr>ed.</abbr>  with  <abbr>FT</abbr>  Velat), a collection of hymns
                        to Mary for each day of the week, which is found in Ethiopic Psalter  <abbr>mss.</abbr>  as
                        well as in the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Meʿerāf</i></span>, a liturgical text which forms
                        part of the Divine Office. Due to his association with the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Weddāsē Māryām</i></span>, Ephrem is usually depicted in Ethiopic iconography
                        standing at the feet of an enthroned Mary (see Hammerschmidt and Jäger,
                        101–8). Ephrem also sometimes bears the sobriquet  <span class="tei-hi"><i>labḥāwi</i></span>  ‘the potter’ in the Ethiopic tradition, likely due to a
                        conflation with  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Shemun-Quqoyo">

                        been edited (Uhlig 1999), it seems that many of them were translated from

                        were only ascribed to Yaʿqub in the Geʿez ms. tradition,  <span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Dersāna sanbat</i></span>  ‘Homily on the Sabbath’ (see Wurmbrand

                        </a>  (7th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>). ʿEnanishoʿ’s work is in turn a large
                        compilation of monastic texts, which includes  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Palladius">

                        attributed to the famous  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  monastic author  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ishaq-of-Nineveh">

                        </a>  (late 7th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>). More specifically, the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Maṣḥafa Mār Yesḥaq</i></span>  is a Geʿez translation of the Arabic collection
                        attributed to Isḥaq. The Arabic version is in turn a translation from a
                        Greek version of writings attributed to Isḥaq, which consists of most of the
                        ‘First Part’ of the original Syriac writings of Isḥaq as well as four
                        homilies by Yoḥannan of Dalyatha and an abbreviated version of the ‘Letter
                        to Patricius’ by Philoxenos of Mabbug. Thus, although the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Filkesyos </i></span>is incorrectly ascribed to Philoxenos, the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i></span>  does still contain a text by this
                         <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  theologian. Outside of the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Maṣḥafa

                        attributed to Syriac-speaking authors, including Ephrem, Yoḥannan of

                         <abbr> ca.</abbr>  850). This contact was mediated by the Christian
                        Arabic tradition, in particular the exegetical works of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ibn-al-Tayyib">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</span>

                        Paradise of Christianity’. In its Geʿez version, E.-Syr. biblical exegesis
                        was transmitted to the Andemta commentary tradition (Cowley 1983, 1988). The
                        Andemta commentaries contain a translation of the Geʿez biblical text into
                        Amharic, the official language of present-day Ethiopia, as well as a wealth
                        of traditional exegetical material (Psalms  <abbr>ed.</abbr>  with  <abbr>ET</abbr>  Stoffregen Pedersen;
                        Hosea  <abbr>ed.</abbr>  with  <abbr>IT</abbr>  Andeberhan). Several anonymous Syriac exegetical homilies
                        are also extant in Geʿez. The Syriac verse homily on Abraham and Sarah in

                        is attributed to  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Basil-of-Caesarea">

                         <abbr>FT</abbr>  Grébaut), are also extant in Geʿez.

                     <p>Among the many interesting aspects of this large body of Geʿez literature
                        that is attributed to Syriac-speaking authors is the fact that several
                        E.-Syr. authors are represented in the Ethiopic tradition, especially in
                        texts related to biblical exegesis and monasticism. The appearance of these
                        E.-Syr. authors is intriguing given that Ethiopic Christianity has
                        throughout its history been dogmatically aligned with the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  Church,
                        not with the  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  In some cases, a work by a  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  author seems to
                        have been stripped of its distinctive E.-Syr. features before it passed into
                        Geʿez. This is, for instance, the case with Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s ‘Commentary on
                        the Gospels’, which is extant both in an original form as well as in an
                        adapted, miaphysite version (<abbr>ed.</abbr>  Y. Manquriyūs,  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Tafsīr
                            al-mašriqī</i></span>  [1908–10]; see Faultless), which served as the textual
                        basis for the Geʿez translation. In other cases, however, it is less clear
                        how Syriac-speaking authors belonging to the  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  found their way into
                        Geʿez.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In addition to the Geʿez literature that is attributed to Syriac-speaking
                        authors, there are a number of originally Greek works that passed through
                        Syriac on their way to the Ethiopic tradition, again almost always with
                        Arabic standing in between. This is, for instance, likely the case with the
                             <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Didascalia-Apostolorum">Didascalia

                        several texts related to the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Alexander-Cycle">Alexander

                             <span class="tei-persName">Aḥiqar</span>
                        </a>  seem to have
                        traveled through Syriac (and then Arabic) on their way to the Ethiopic
                        tradition, where they are transmitted in late  <abbr>mss.</abbr>  of the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Maṣḥafa falāsfa ṭabibān</i></span>  ‘Book of the wise philosophers’ (see U.
                        Pietruschka, in  <span class="tei-hi"><i>

                        </i></span>, vol. 2, 485–6). A similar
                        trajectory is likely for the related narrative about Aḥiqar that is
                        preserved in Geʿez (<abbr>ed.</abbr>  with  <abbr>FT</abbr>  Schneider).
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>It is clear then that Geʿez literature from the Solomonic period, which
                        includes a number of texts that are attributed to Syriac-speaking authors as
                        well as texts that passed through Syriac on their way to Geʿez, provides an
                        example of Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity. It must be stressed,
                        however, that this Syriac influence was in most, if not all, cases mediated
                        by Arabic Christianity.</p>
                     
                     <p>The Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in the Solomonic period can be
                        explained by various points of contact. During the reign of Yekunno Amlāk
                        (1270–85) at the beginning of the Solomonic period, it appears that a
                        ‘Syrian’ became head of the Ethiopian Church, a position normally restricted
                        to Coptic monks (see Tamrat, 69–72). Though this seems to have been short
                        lived, it clearly demonstrates a Syriac presence in Ethiopia at this time.
                        Outside of Ethiopia, contacts between Ethiopic and Syriac Christianity
                        occurred at various locations. Ethiopic monks are known to have lived in
                        several monastic communities in Egypt alongside Syriac monks (in general,
                        see O. Meinardus, in  <span class="tei-hi"><i>
                             <abbr>EAe</abbr>
                        </i></span>, vol. 2, 243–5). Both Syriac
                        and Ethiopic monks also resided at the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Catherine-Monastery-of-St">

                        </a>  (Cerulli, 1943–7, vol. 1, 148 and 151). In addition,
                        contacts between Syriac and Ethiopic monks took place in  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Jerusalem">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Jerusalem</span>

                        the various Christian communities were represented (Cerulli 1943–7).
                        Finally, moving closer to the Syriac homeland, Ethiopic monks were present
                        from the 13th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  onwards in Lebanon and Syria, and some may have possibly
                        played a role in the renaming of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Musa-al-Habashi-Dayr-Mar">
