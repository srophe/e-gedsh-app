                     <p>Despite widespread translation activity and the use of Syr. in Late Antiquity
                        by numerous non-native speakers, there are no surviving Syr. lexical
                        materials from this early period, with the exception of two 4th-cent.
                        Manichaean Syr.-Coptic glossaries written on wooden boards, found in the
                        kitchen of an abandoned house at Kellis in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt
                        (Franzmann and Gardner). These were produced by the translator of a Syr.
                        text into Coptic, and so the order of the Syr. words is determined by their
                        occurrence in the source text. It is likely that similar glossaries will
                        have been produced by other Syr. translators, and particularly in the 7th
                         <abbr>cent.</abbr>  when formal one-to-one Greek to Syr. correspondences were common, but
                        these have not survived.

                     <p>Lexical works of a different kind were produced by the Syr. scribal schools,
                        whose careful transmission of biblical and patristic texts led to the
                        production of a ‘masoretic’ literature that is comparable in many respects
                        to that of contemporary Jewish scribes (see  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Masora">Masora</a>). Some texts
                        preserve the correct pronunciation of rare words or foreign names, others
                        provide lists of homographs. These lists are often included within
                        grammatical texts, mainly of  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  origin, and are associated with such
                        figures as  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yawsep-Huzaya">

                     <p>The first real Syr. lexica, containing alphabetic lists of words and their
                        glosses, were produced in 9th-cent. Abbasid  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Baghdad">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Baghdad</span>
                        </a>  by
                        professional translators of Greek scientific texts into Syr. and Arabic,
                        rather than monastic scribes, and were often focused on explaining Greek
                        technical loan-words in Syr., and other rare vocabulary, rather than listing
                        all Syr. lexemes. One of the first of these was Ḥunayn  <abbr>b.</abbr>  Isḥāq’s  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Puššāq šmāhe yawnāye b-suryāye</i></span>  ‘The interpretation of
                        Greek words with Syriac’. In addition to his work on Greek words and his
                        work on Syriac homographs, Ḥunayn is said to have written a ‘Compendious
                        Lexicon’ (Assemani,  <span class="tei-hi"><i>BibOr</i></span>, vol. 3.1, 165). Hunayn’s
                        lexicographical works were augmented by  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Isho-of-Merv">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Ishoʿ of Merv</span>
                        </a>
                        (who may or may not be the same person as Zekarya of Merv), and this was in
                        turn re-edited by one of Ḥunayn’s students,  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bar-Ali-Isho">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Ishoʿ bar

                        </a>, and in this Syr.-Arabic form it still survives (Hoffmann
                        1874; Gottheil 1910, 1928).

                     <p>The largest of all these early Syr.-Arabic lexica (often more like an
                        encyclopedia than a dictionary), and the most useful for scholars today, is
                        that of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bar-Bahlul-Hasan">

                        1888–1901). He cites many earlier lexical sources, one of the most important
                        of which was  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Henanisho-bar-Seroshway">

                   <abbr>ca.</abbr>  900. This
                        lexicon was widely copied by both E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. scribes until the 20th
                         <abbr>cent.</abbr>, and they continued to add entries and citations and to edit older
                        entries in line with their own theology and christology. One adaptation of
                        Bar Bahlul and Bar ʿAli even has the Arabic replaced with Armenian in Syriac
                             <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Script-Syriac">script</a>, possibly for the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">

                        edition of this work is not a critical edition of the earliest form of the
                        work (probably irretrievable) but is largely based on W.-Syr. manuscripts
                        containing the fullest form of the lexicon, and so includes, for example,
                        references to the 13th-cent. Bar ʿEbroyo.

                     <p>With the beginning of Syriac printing in Europe in the 16th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, there was
                        a growing demand for Syr.- Latin lexica. The first of these was the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Syrorum peculium</i></span>  of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Masius-Andreas">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Andreas
                            Masius</span>
                        </a>  (1571), included in the sixth volume of the Antwerp
                        Polyglot Bible, which like many early European Syr. lexica mostly contained
                        Syr. vocabulary from the  <abbr>NT</abbr>, with some  <abbr>OT</abbr>  additions. More widely used than
                        Masius’ work was the frequently reprinted  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Lexicon
                            pentaglotton</i></span>  of Valentino Schindler (1612) and the  <abbr>NT</abbr>  lexica of
                        Johann Buxtorf the younger (1622), Martin Trost (1623), Aegidius Gutbier
                        (1667), and Carl Schaaf (1708). Castell’s  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Lexicon
                            Heptaglotton</i></span>  (1669), which was printed to accompany Walton’s London
                        Polyglot Bible, was the first to incorporate all the Syr. of the  <abbr>OT</abbr>  as well
                        as to make systematic use of the medieval Syr.-Arabic lexica. Michaelis
                        extracted the Syr. vocabulary from Castell and republished it in 1788, and
                        this became the standard Syr. lexicon in the early-19th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, although much
                        criticised.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The late-19th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  saw the production of numerous major Syr. lexica which
                        remain key reference works today (although they pre-date most critical
                        editions of Syr. texts). The largest was the  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Thesaurus
                            syriacus</i></span>  (1868–1901) of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Payne-Smith-Robert">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Robert Payne
                            Smith</span>
                        </a>, which built upon the unpublished lexical  <abbr>mss.</abbr>  of numerous
                        European colleagues, especially Quatremère and Bernstein, and middle-eastern
                        lexica, both the medieval texts mentioned above and the 1619 lexicon of the
                        Maronite George Karmsedinoyo, and contains numerous citations, as well as
                        proper names. Smith was assisted by his daughter  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Payne-Smith-Mrs-Margoliouth-Jessie">

                        2nd  <abbr>ed.</abbr>  1923–28) which includes some rare vocabulary not found in the work
                        of the Smiths, and has now been translated into English and expanded by
                        Sokoloff. Very important Syr. lexica printed in the middle-east include that
                        of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Audo-Toma">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Toma

                        </a>  (1897, 1901) which contains a very great number of old Syr.
                        forms not found in the European lexica, and so to a lesser extent the
                        Syr.-Arabic lexicon of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Manna-Yaqob-Awgen">

                        </a>  (1900). Notable 20th-cent. lexica include the

                     <p>The world-wide  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diaspora">diaspora</a>  of Syr.-using Christians, and
                        the arrival of Syr. word-processing software, has produced an explosion of
                        Syr. lexica in recent decades. These are notable for including Classical
                        Syr. neologisms for modern ideological and technological terminology, and
                        some particularly useful examples were published by Hanna and Bulut (2000),
                        Khoshaba and Youkhana (2000), and Afram (2005).

                     <p>Although Christian Neo-Aramaic was included in Payne Smith’s  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Thesaurus</i></span>, the first dedicated dictionary was the
                        Assyrian-Russian work of Kalashev (1894), soon followed by the important
                        Assyrian-English dictionary of Maclean (1901). Large lexica of the Christian
                        NENA dialects were later published by David (1924), Sarmas (1969, 1980), and
                        Sargizi (2002), and less comprehensive lexica of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Turoyo">Ṭuroyo</a>  by Ritter
                        (1979), Jacob and Asmar (1985), and Ishaq (1988).
