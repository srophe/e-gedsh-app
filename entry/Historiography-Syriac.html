                     <p>The beginnings of writing history in Syriac remain unknown, but one may
                        connect it to the existence of notes on various events that were kept in the
                        royal archives of Osrhoene (although there must have been similar archives
                        in other  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aramaic">Aramaic</a>-speaking countries,  <span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>in  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Adiabene">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Adiabene</span>
                        </a>, we have
                        no information about them). The notes per se are not historiography, but
                        they could be used to construct a narrative of some kind about the past.
                        After the end of the kingdom of Osrhoene, the materials from the royal
                        archives, at least partly, found their way to the episcopal archives. This
                        can be inferred from the first W.-Syr. local chronicle that we know, the
                             <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Chronicle-of-Edessa">Chronicle of
                            Edessa</a>, written soon after 532 in which local material from both
                        the pre-Christian epoch (such as the chronologically first note: ‘The year
                        180 [of the Seleucid era  = 132/1 BC]: kings began to reign in Edessa.’) and
                        Christian epoch was included.
                     </p>
                     <span class="tei-label">Chronicle Writing</span>
                     
                     <p>The Chronicle of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Edessa</span>
                        </a>  opens the
                        series of local chronicles (which occasionally also have notes on non-local
                        events,  <span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>on the birth of Jesus or the accession of Roman emperors). A
                        comparison of this Chronicle with other chronicles of similar character has
                        revealed that it is an excerpt from a more extensive, not extant, work
                        conventionally called the Original Chronicle of Edessa. Some of the notes
                        (lemmata) of the latter that are not present in the extant Chronicle of
                        Edessa can be found in other Syriac chronicles,  <span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>the Chronicle to the
                        year 819. In its first part it seems to have followed quite closely the
                        Original Chronicle of Edessa, but in the second part it notes other events:
                        a series of lemmata recount events connected with the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Gabriel-Monastery-of-Mor">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</span>
                        </a>, from which it may be inferred that its
                        author was a monk of that monastery.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>What the local chronicles also have in common is their annalistic structure,
                        which means that they present historical events in short pieces of
                        information, called lemmata. These begin with a year date and state what
                        happened that year. A typical such lemma is for instance ‘The year 672:
                        Walgash, bishop of Nisibis, died...’.</p>
                     
                     <p>There were certainly other chronicles of this type, which however have not
                        survived. We have several fragments of such works, sometimes only a few
                        folios long, but still valuable for the historical information they provide,
                        as for instance one very mutilated folio that brings information on the Arab
                        conquest of Syria in the beginning of the 7th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, or a fragment of a
                        Chronicle up to the year 813 (<span class="tei-hi"><i>Chronica minora</i></span>, II
                        & III).
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In addition to historical information of local character soon another type of
                        historiographic literature developed, the so-called universal (or world)
                        chronicles. This genre was implanted in Syriac by translation of two
                        chronicles written in Greek, those of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Hippolytus-of-Rome">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Hippolytus of
                            Rome</span>
                        </a>  and  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Eusebius-of-Caesarea">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Eusebius of
                            Caesarea</span>
                        </a>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The first of them seems to have been intended not as a continuous exposition
                        of the events of world history, but rather as a gazetteer providing
                        geographical, ethnographical, and linguistic information on the then known
                        world, in addition to data on the early history of mankind, culled from the
                        Bible. The Chronicle of Hippolytus of Rome (d. 235), or rather its material
                        (as it had a complicated transmission history) is also known as the Division
                        of the earth (<span class="tei-hi"><i>Diamerismos tēs gēs</i></span>),  <span class="tei-corr">i.e., </span>between the
                        sons of Noah, since geographical lists (of countries, mountains, rivers,
                        islands), ethnographical (of various peoples), linguistic (of languages
                        including those that have written literature), and historical were all
                        expressed within the account of the vicissitudes of the three sons of Noah
                        and their progeny. They were believed to have divided the world into their
                        respective possessions. In Syriac several versions of Hippolytos’s material
                        are known, sometimes only fragmentarily preserved, either as separate texts
                        (Peoples after the confusion of languages in Babylon, On the families of
                        languages), or  — more often — incorporated into larger works, be it
                        chronicles (the Chronicle to the year 724, the Chronicle of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Michael-I-Rabo">

                     <p>The Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 339) had a very specific form,
                        called canons: it was written in the form of tables with parallel columns in
                        which the years of the rulers of all nations or states known to him were
                        enumerated (the so-called  <span class="tei-hi"><i>fila regnorum</i></span>), whereas on
                        both sides of these columns, the so-called  <span class="tei-hi"><i>spatium
                            historicum</i></span>, notes on various events were placed (Witakowski
                        1999–2000). The Chronicle was translated into Syriac in the 6th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  It has
                        not been preserved, but it was used by many later Syr. chroniclers, thanks
                        to whom we know relatively well how it was structured and what it contained.
                        The work of Eusebius was expanded by later Greek chroniclers (Annianos [5th
                         <abbr>cent.</abbr>] and Andronikos [6th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>]), who added material from the creation of
                        the world (Eusebius started his canons from Abraham) and continued its
                        narrative up to their time. These chronicles were translated into Syriac
                        too, but none of them is extant.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The earliest Syr. chronicle which used Eusebius’s work as its source is the
                        so-called Maronite Chronicle, written after 664. Its author supplemented the
                        Eusebian material with material from other sources and notes on the history
                        of the Maronites. He continued it until his own epoch, adding notes on the
                        history of the Arabs. The Maronite Chronicle does not have the column
                        form.</p>
                     
                     <p>Even earlier than the work just named is the Melkite Chronicle, composed
                        after 638, which, however, did not use the Chronicle of Eusebius. It brings
                        Old Testament chronology, and for the Christian period, lists of patriarchs
                        of the main sees, becoming more informative only from the epoch of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Nestorius">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Nestorius</span>
                        </a>. Its Melkite origin is clear from the presence of
                        anti-Miaphysite anathemas (<abbr>ed.</abbr>  de Halleux).
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The Eusebian model is on the other hand clearly seen in the Chronicle of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Edessa">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Yaʿqub of Edessa</span>
                        </a>  (d. 708). This work, only fragmentarily
                        preserved, has the column format of Eusebius. Yaʿqub did not copy Eusebius’s
                        work, only continued it. He provided material on the history of the Church,
                        of the Byzantine empire, and of Persia, a country which Eusebius totally
                        neglected, but which the Syr. historians for obvious reasons could not
                        (Witakowski 2008).
                     </p>
                     <span class="tei-label">Ecclesiastical History Writing</span>
                     
                     <p>Eusebius’s influence in Syr. historiography is seen not only in chronography,
                        but also in another genre of history writing, namely ecclesiastical (or
                        church) history (Syr.  <span class="tei-hi"><i>eqlisiyasṭiqi</i></span>). Eusebius’s
                        Ecclesiastical History was very soon, in any case before the middle of the
                        5th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, translated into Syriac (Van Rompay 1994), and contrary to the
                        Chronicle it has been preserved, though with lacunae. It was used by later
                        Syr. historians, whereby the genre of ecclesiastical history was implanted
                        in Syriac historiography.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History found continuators in Greek too, and the
                        work of at least one of them, Socrates Scholasticus (d.  <abbr>ca.</abbr>  450), was
                        translated into Syriac, and has been preserved both in excerpts and in an
                        abbreviated form (not published). Whether works of other continuators of
                        Eusebius, Sozomen, and  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Theodoret-of-Cyrrhus">

                        preserved, is not certain. On the other hand, at least two fragments of the
                        latter’s ‘Religious History’ were translated into Syriac: the lives of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Nisibis">
                             <span class="tei-persName">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</span>

                        </a>. What is extant in Syriac is a translation of another
                        Ecclesiastical History, namely that of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Zacharias-Rhetor">

                        valuable as the Greek original is lost. Zacharias was a Miaphysite, which is
                        why copying his works in Greek was discontinued, whereas they have survived
                        in Syriac translations. The Syriac version of his Ecclesiastical History was
                        incorporated into a larger compilation supplied with hagiographical and
                        other material and continued until the year 569, by an anonymous historian
                        who for lack of a better name is referred to as  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Zacharias-Pseudo-">Pseudo-Zacharias</a>.

                        of his life in Constantinople. Only the last, the third, part of his
                        Ecclesiastical History has survived in a separate  <abbr>ms.</abbr>  tradition. We owe to
                        Yuḥanon also another work, the ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’, which is a
                        collection of lives of Syr. ascetics, most of whom Yuḥanon knew
                        personally.

                        Chronicle whose anonymous author was a monk in the monastery of Zuqnin near

                             <span class="tei-placeName">Amid</span>
                        </a>
                        (8th  cent.). The Chronicle, composed in 775, was previously called the
                        Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysios, but is now mostly referred to as the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Zuqnin-Chronicle-of">Chronicle of Zuqnin</a>. Although the author used Eusebian material,
                        his work, especially in later parts, does not present information in short
                        lemmata, but has extensive excerpts from other kinds of sources. In fact it
                        is the largest Syr. historiographical work written until the 8th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>,
                        introducing a new genre: developed chronicle. The annalistic structure is
                        kept (though there are no canons) but the author often inserted material
                        from his sources in large extracts or in their entirety. His main sources
                        are the Bible, the Chronicle of Eusebius, the Ecclesiastical History of
                        Socrates, and that of Yuḥanon of Ephesus, while the last part contains his
                        own material. He used many other sources, including works which have been
                        subsequently lost (Witakowski 1987). One of such works, most probably copied
                        by him in its entirety, is the Chronicle of Pseudo-<a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yeshu-the-Stylite">

                     <p>With this first developed chronicle in Syriac, the genre difference between
                        chronicle and ecclesiastical history was abolished.</p>
                     
                     <p>It does not mean however that short chronicles were no longer composed. The
                        material published under the title of the Chronicle to the year 724
                        (anonymous, but see Palmer 1992) is actually not a chronicle in the meaning
                        of a planned and elaborate historiographic work, but a collection of series
                        of lemmata culled from various sources, including the Chronicle of
                        Hippolytus, the Chronicle of Eusebius, together with its Antiochene
                        Continuation (Burgess 1999), an account of Church councils, and a list of
                        Umayyad caliphs, put down one after another without the chronological order.
                        In fact for many lemmata dates are missing.</p>
                     
                     <p>The Chronicle to the year 846 is again a short lemma chronicle. Although the
                        preserved text starts from the birth of Levi, the son of the Old Testament
                        patriarch Jacob (there are many lacunae further on in the text too), there
                        can be no doubt that it was a universal chronicle. It includes material
                        taken from several sources, such as the Chronicle of Eusebius for universal
                        history, and  — for local data — the Original Chronicle of Edessa, the
                        Chronicle to the year 819, the  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Addai-Teaching-of">Teaching of
                            Addai</a>, the Ecclesiastical Histories of Yuḥanon of Ephesus and
                        Zacharias of Mitylene, lists of bishops of various sees, and accounts of
                        church councils.

                     <p>Later chronicles, written during the period of the so-called  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Renaissance-Syriac">Syriac
                            Renaissance</a>, are all of the developed type. These are the
                        Chronicle of Michael Rabo (d. 1199), the anonymous  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Chronicle-of-1234">Chronicle of
                            1234</a>, and the Chronicle of Bar ʿEbroyo (d. 1286). From the
                        indications of the sources that the authors of these works have made (<span class="tei-corr">e.g.,</span>
                        the Chronicles by Basil of Edessa,  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Dionysios-bar-Salibi">

                        </a>, etc.) we know that there was much more
                        historiographical literature composed before the epoch of Michael Rabo, but
                        none of them is extant. (For the latter Chronicle, see the entry on Michael
                        Rabo.)

                     <p>The author of the anonymous Chronicle of 1234, was probably a monk of the
                             <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Barsawmo-Dayro-d-Mor">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Dayro d-Mor
                            Barṣawmo</span>
                        </a>, and seems to have had some more or less official
                        auxiliary ecclesiastical duties. He was a native of Edessa, which can be
                        seen in his detailed notes on the events of the history of that city. Most
                        of them, it is true, were taken from the lost Edessene chronicle of Basil
                        Bar Shumana, the metropolitan of Edessa, but they continue even after the
                        date of the latter’s death (1171). The Chronicle was begun as a simple work
                        of universal history, but after the epoch of Constantine the abundance of
                        material to be dealt with caused the author to divide it into two parts,
                        ecclesiastical and secular. The Edessene author used many of the sources
                        that Michael Rabo did, but independently from him: he did not know Michael’s
                        work.

                     <p>Dividing historiographical works into two parts became a solution also with
                        Bar ʿEbroyo. With his Chronicle the classical period of W.-Syr.
                        historiography ends. (For further information on his work, see the entry on

                        composed by one Mshiḥa Zkha. When a  <abbr>ms.</abbr>  containing an account of early
                        Christian history in Adiabene was discovered and published in 1907, it
                        seemed to its finder and editor (A. Mingana) that it was Mshiḥa Zkha’s work.
                        This identification may not be correct, and in fact today it is referred to
                        as an anonymous Chronicle of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Arbela">
                             <span class="tei-placeName">Arbela</span>
                        </a>. It is a
                        collection of biographies of 20 bps. of this see, from the early 2nd  <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        up to the middle of the 6th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>, when it was probably composed. The
                        authenticity of the Chronicle of Arbela was questioned (because of forgery
                        of the only known  <abbr>ms.</abbr>  of the Chronicle; Fiey 1967), but the opinion of most
                        scholars today is rather in favor of the authenticity of at least large
                        parts of the material of the Chronicle (Kawerau 1985).

                        reign of Hormizd IV (579–90) until the Arab conquest. The Chronicle seems to
                        be an excerpt from a larger (not preserved) work on ecclesiastical history,
                        the author of which was, according to some scholars, Eliya metropolitan of

                     <p>The E.-Syr. authors were perhaps more interested in monastic history than the
                        W.-Syr. historians. One work of this type is the ‘Book of the Abbots of the

                     <p>The Chronicle of Eliya of Nisibis (d. 1046) is the only E.-Syr. universal
                        chronicle of the Eusebian type. In the first, so-called chronographical,
                        part Eliya, following Eusebius, gathered lists of Old Testament patriarchs,
                        kings, and rulers of various countries, together with an annotated list of
                        the catholicoi of the  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  The next part, the canons, is written in
                        columns, but Eliya uses them in a different way from Eusebius. From right to
                        left they contain: 1. dates given in the Seleucid era, and, for the Muslim
                        period, in the era of Hijra; 2. the source of the entry (it is here that we
                        learn of many Syr. historiographic works that once existed), which as a
                        regularly recurring piece of information is exceptional in Syr. chronicle
                        writing; and 3. the actual lemmata given in two languages, Syriac and Arabic
                        (an indication that the Arabization of the E. Syrians had already made some
                        progress). Eliya’s sources include Eusebius’s Chronicle, Socrates’s
                        Ecclesiastical History, and W.-Syr. works: the Chronicle of Yuḥanon ‘the
                        Jacobite’,  <span class="tei-corr">i.e., </span>Yuḥanon of Ephesus, Chronicle of Yaʿqub of Edessa, and a
                        list of the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  patriarchs. This shows exchange between the
                        intellectuals of the two Syr.-speaking churches. Among the E.-Syr. sources
                        he quotes a list of the catholicoi and a chronicle of the metropolitans of
                             <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Nisibis">

                        </a>, but also Arabic sources. Altogether he quotes  <abbr>ca.</abbr>  60
                        sources of which half are unknown (Pinggéra 2006; Witakowski 2007).

                     <p>From the last period of the classical epoch of Syr. literature comes the

                        across Asia, and in its second part Ṣawma’s across Europe. As such it is
                        unique in Syriac literature. It provides an insight into the contacts
                        between geographically remote provinces and the center of the once
                        pan-Asiatic  <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>  before its decline in the subsequent epoch.

                     <p>E.-Syr. authors wrote also historiographic works in Arabic. The change of the
                        language occurred gradually, the first step being taken by Eliya of Nisibis
                        who used both languages in the same work. There is no doubt, however, that
                        works such as the Chronicle of  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Siirt">

                        although written in Arabic, were based on Syriac sources.
