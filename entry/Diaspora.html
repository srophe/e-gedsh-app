                     <p>Prior to the late 19th  <abbr>cent.</abbr>  there had been very little emigration from the
                        Middle East, whereas today there are more Christians from the Syriac (and
                        other Middle Eastern) Churches living in the Diaspora than remain in the
                        homelands. The two main causes of this massive demographic change are 1. the
                        massacres in Syria and Lebanon of 1860, and especially those in Eastern
                        Turkey of 1895/6 and of 1915 (see  <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Sayfo">Sayfo</a>) and following
                        years; and 2. the continuing unsettled political situation, involving wars
                        and civil strife, in many countries of the Middle East, where certain events
                        in particular have given rise to renewed waves of emigration, notably in
                        1933 after the end of the British Mandate in Iraq (1932), involving the
                        Assyrians; the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the three
                        subsequent wars (1956, 1967, 1973), involving the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  in Palestine;
                        the Lebanese civil war (1975–1990), involving the Maronites and other Syr.
                        communities in Lebanon; the Turkish-Kurdish conflict in Eastern Turkey,
                        involving mainly the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>; the Iraqi-Kurdish conflict, followed by the
                        Iraq-Iran war (1980–88), the Gulf war (1990–1), and the invasion of Iraq
                        (2003), involving the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Syr. Catholic, and  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  In
                        all these upheavals displacement and emigration has also been to other
                        countries within the Middle East (or even within the same country), as well
                        as to countries outside it (with or without refugee status). A further cause
                        of emigration has been the lack of educational or employment opportunities
                        in the countries of origin; this had already led to the earliest immigration
                        to the United States (<a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Chicago">

                     <p>The massacres of 1895/6 and 1915–18 led to large scale emigration, both
                        within the Middle East (mainly to Syria, Lebanon, Palestine in the case of
                        the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>; to Iraq, Iran, and the Caucasus [and thence, to Russia] in
                        the case of the Chaldeans and Assyrians) and to the West, above all at this
                        stage to the Americas, both North and South. The flight of Assyrians from
                        Iraq in 1933 resulted in new settlements in eastern Syria, while others
                        emigrated to Britain and especially the United States. The Americas were
                        also the goal of most of those emigrating after the creation of Israel, and
                        it has only been in the last 50 years that large numbers from all the Syr.
                        Churches have emigrated to countries of western Europe, with a preponderance
                        of  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  settling in Germany (where the first priest was ordained in
                        1977) and Sweden, and of Chaldeans and Maronites in France. An important
                        development in the case of the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  was the founding of three
                        monasteries by the late  <abbr>bp.</abbr>

                        Germany, 2000). Smaller communities from the different Syr. Churches are
                        also found in Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland,
                        Austria, Italy, Britain, and Greece. More recently emigration on a large
                        scale has also been to Australia. A pattern followed in many cases has been
                        for emigrés from a particular village to settle together in their new home.
                        Since 2003 it has been Syria, Jordan, and Turkey that have been the
                        immediate goals of those fleeing from the dangerous situation in Iraq.

                     <p>The increasing sizes of the Diaspora communities has led to the creation of
                        new dioceses outside the Middle East, following on from the earlier
                        establishment of church communities in the different countries. The main

                        was emigration. The following listing of Diaspora dioceses gives some idea
                        of the geographical spread for each of the Syr. Churches; figures for

                     <p>The different Indian Churches of Syr. tradition also have considerable
                        diasporas all over the world, and several now have a North American diocese
                        (Syro-Malabar: Chicago, since 2001; Syro-Malankara: for America and Europe,
                        since 2005; Syrian Orthodox: Cartaret, New Jersey; Orthodox Syrian: Alma,
                        Michigan, and Belrose, New York). There are communities in several European
                        countries from all the Syr. Churches in India (especially Great Britain,
                        Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria). Many from Kerala go as
                        temporary workers to the Gulf states, in some of which churches have been
                        built.</p>
                     
                     <p>The above locations only cover countries where church communities have been
                        established; for individuals from the Syr. Churches of the Middle East, the
                        scatter is much wider, and includes countries of Africa and East Asia.</p>
                     
                     <p>The move to secular societies where ethnic and cultural, rather than
                        religious, identity is paramount has caused much dispute in the search for
                        appropriate names to use (Aramaean, Assyrian, Chaldean, Assyro-Chaldean,
                        Syriac,  <span class="tei-hi"><i>Suryoyo</i></span>, etc.), and the issue has often
                        proved sadly divisive, especially among the  <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>  On the other hand,
                        many new opportunities have been opened up, for the creation of cultural and
                        other associations, and for new educational possibilities. In the 1930s when
                        for a time it was Soviet policy to encourage minority languages, the written
                        use of Modern Syriac (in Latin script) was encouraged; a more recent
                        adaptation of the spoken language to western script has taken place with
                             <a href="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Turoyo">Turoyo</a>  in Sweden. Especially important has been the freedom to
                        publish in western countries. This has given rise to a great many cultural
                        magazines, often multilingual (and including both Classical and Modern
                        Syriac), as well as the creation of television channels (such as Suryoyo
                        SAT, Suroyo TV, Assyrian TV); it has also made it possible to publish
                        information about  <span class="tei-corr">the </span>
                         <span class="tei-hi"><i>Sayfo</i></span>. Another notable development
                        has been in the creation of music groups, both church-based and secular, the
                        latter using lyrics in both Classical and Modern Syriac; though this
                        development had its origins in the Middle East (<span class="tei-corr">e.g., </span>Qamishli in the 1960s,
                        and rather earlier in Iran), it has been greatly developed in the
                        Diaspora.
