( fl. first half of the 8th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] Bp. of Ṭirhan. According to the ‘Catalogue’ of ʿAbdishoʿ (chap. 111), Shahdost wrote a ‘synodical oration, some letters along with canons, and some short discourses and turgame’ . What survives, however, are some quite extensive extracts from a work ‘On why we are separated from the Westerners’, preserved in a collection of E.-Syr. christological texts (where he is also called Eustathios). The theological polemic is primarily aimed against the Miaphysites and it contains what is probably a veiled criticism of the revision of the Peshitta NT commissioned by Philoxenos . The ‘Chronicle of Siirt ’ (chap. 18; PO 4.3, 70) reports in passing that he attributed the Nativity ʿOnitha l-yaldā tmihā ( Ḥudrā , ed. Darmo, I, 348 = Bedjan, Breviarium Chaldaicum , I, 321) to one of the 318 Fathers of Nicaea. Sources L.  Abramowski and A. E.  Goodman, A Nestorian Collection of Christological Texts (1972), vol. I, 1–57 (Syr.), vol. II, xxvi–xxxii, 3–36 ( ET ). Sebastian P. Brock",
