(late 4th cent. ) Greek author of theological and exegetical works ( CPG 3815–22), bp. of Tarsus. A native of Antioch , and teacher of John Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia , he was renowned in his own day as an exegete. As an important representative of Antiochene christology and exegesis, his works came under a cloud, along with those of Theodore, in the 6th cent. and so much has been lost, though his Commentary on Psalms escaped thanks to its re-attribution to Anastasius (Ps. 1–50, ed. J.-M. Olivier, CCSG 6, 1980; the remainder in PG 33). Although he is regarded as one of the three ‘Greek Doctors’ (with Theodore and Nestorius ) in the Ch. of E. , most of what survives in Syriac comes from hostile sources. Quotations from, or references to, his ‘On Providence’, however, are to be found notably in Dadishoʿ and Isḥaq of Nineveh . Sources CPG 3815–3822.
