Originating from Beth Qaṭraye (like Isḥaq of Nineveh ), he was later associated (again, like Isḥaq) with the Monastery of Rabban Shabur. Nothing further is known of his life. His surviving writings consist of a learned Commentary on the Asceticon of Isaiah of Scetis ; a Commentary on the Paradise of the Fathers, compiled by ʿEnanishoʿ ; a treatise on Stillness ( šelyā ), concerning the monastic practice of retreats for seven weeks in solitude; a Letter to Abkosh, also on Stillness, and various short texts concerning the spiritual life. The Commentary on the Paradise of the Fathers was translated into Sogdian (only a fragment survives), Arabic, and Ethiopic. There is also a fragment of his Commentary on Abba Isaiah in Sogdian.
