Several of his works were translated into Syriac, the most important of which is a ‘Discourse on the Passible and Impassible in God’, addressed to Theopompus, whose Greek original is lost ( ed. de Lagarde, 46–64; ET in Slusser, 152–73). the ‘Wonderworker’ (3rd cent. ) Greek author ( CPG 1763–94). Several of his works were translated into Syriac, the most important of which is a ‘Discourse on the Passible and Impassible in God’, addressed to Theopompus, whose Greek original is lost ( ed. de Lagarde, 46–64; ET in Slusser, 152–73). His other works in Syriac include a ‘Treatise on Consubstantiality’ and a short work (also in Arabic) on the soul ( CPG 1773); this last is wrongly attributed to him (see Brock). A Life ( BHO 356; ed. Bedjan; GT by Ryssel) and the panegyric on him by Gregory of Nyssa ( CPG 3184; ET in Slusser, 41–87) also survive in Syriac translation: these independently draw on local traditions.
