(early 5th cent. ) Chorepiscopos and poet writing in the region of Aleppo . His five madroše on Aqaq, bp. of Beroea (Aleppo), who died in 436, provide the only indication of his date and locality ( ed. Overbeck, 259–69). These poems are very general in character and more interesting is his madrošo on the Dedication of a new church in Chalcis (Qenneshrin; translations by Graffin and McVey). According to the oldest ms. of the 12 memre on the patriarch Joseph ( ed. Bedjan), these too were by Balai, rather than Ephrem ; it remains unclear which attribution is correct (Phenix prefers Balai). Later tradition knows Balai primarily as the originator of the five-syllable meter (also identified as ḥoʾen l-ḥaṭoye ), in which numerous boʿwoto and takšpoto are written (samples are given by Zetterstéen); the real authorship of these remains uncertain.
