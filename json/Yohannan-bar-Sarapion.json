Sarābiyūn http:\/\/syriaca.org\/person\/822 person Medical writer of the late 9th (or less likely, late 8th) cent. Yūḥannā b. Sarābiyūn (8th\/9th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] Medical writer of the late 9th (or less likely, late 8th) cent. He was the author of ‘The Great Compendium’ (in 12 books) and ‘The Small Compendium’ (in 7 books); the Syriac originals of both of these are lost (though a few short quotations are preserved in Bar Bahlul ’s ‘Lexicon’). Both works were translated into Arabic, and ‘the Small Compendium’ was particularly influential: it was translated three times into Arabic, and twice into Latin. In Arabic only Books 5–7 survive (in the translation by Mūsā b. Ibrāhīm al-Ḥadīthī, ( fl. ca. 930), but both Latin translations are preserved complete: the first, by Gerard of Cremona (12th cent. ) was first printed in 1525, and the second, by Andreas Alpagus (who made considerable use of the first), was published in Venice in 1550.
