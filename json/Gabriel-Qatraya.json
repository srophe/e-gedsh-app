(6th\/7th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] Author of an important Commentary on the Liturgy. Several Gabriels from Beth Qaṭraye are known from the 6th\/7th cent. , but this Gabriel (described as bar Lipeh) is probably not to be equated with any of the others. A  date of writing prior to the liturgical reforms of Ishoʿyahb III is certain, since he mentions that Shubḥalmaran , metropolitan of Karka d-Beth Slokh was still alive. The Commentary is divided into 5 memre , each with a series of questions and answers. These cover: 1. ramšā on weekdays (15 questions); 2. ṣaprā on weekdays (17 questions); 3. ramšā and lelyā on Sundays (5 questions); 4. ṣaprā on Sundays (9 questions); 5. Eucharistic Mysteries (8 questions, the second of which is a commentary on the Eucharistic rite). This important work is preserved in a single ms. (Brit. Libr. Or. 3336) of the 13th cent. (though the ms. has a date, its reading is uncertain); so far only the commentary on the Eucharist has been published and translated. An abbreviated form of at least much of the work is attributed to Abraham bar Lipeh ( ed. R. H.  Connolly, in CSCO 71, 76; 1911, 1915). The relationship between Gabriel and Abraham is not clear.
