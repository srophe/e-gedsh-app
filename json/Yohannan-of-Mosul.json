The work was published in Rome in 1868 by Eliya Yoḥannan Millos, Chald. metropolitan of ʿAqra, together with various other texts, under the title Directorium Spirituale ; on the title page Millos gives the date of its composition as 1245 (though on what authority is not clear; on p. 113 there is a note to say that the memrā on the Mysteries was written in AH 622 = AD 1225).
