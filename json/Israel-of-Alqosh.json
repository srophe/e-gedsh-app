(around the end of the 16th and the first decades of the 17th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] E.-Syr. priest, poet, scholar, and scribe, founder of the Shikwānā (or Qashā) family of scribes. He is considered the leader and inspirer of the so-called School of Alqosh . A number of liturgical works in Classical Syriac are attributed to him: a revision of the E.-Syr. calendar, preserved in an Alqosh ms. dated 1705; a ʿonithā ‘On Repentance’ (1590\/1; ed. G. Cardahi, De arte poetica Syrorum [1875], 97–100); a turgāmā , preserved in a ms. dated 1726, now in Cambridge; a number of ḥuttāme ‘funeral hymns’ and funeral laments, preserved in various 18th- or 19th-cent. mss. of European and Iraqi collections ( e.g. e.g., ms. Groningen, Add. 326, f. 139b–141b). Scribal headings and authorial or editorial interventions in the text lead us to attribute to Israel the following dorekyāthā in Sureth : ‘On Perfection’ (dated 1610\/1 in the text), ‘On the Sin of Man’ (a poetic adaptation of the Syriac Revelation of Paul), and ‘On Shmuni and her Seven Sons’ (1610\/1 or 1631\/2).
