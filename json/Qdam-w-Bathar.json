Book of before and after [Ch. of E., Chald. ] Book containing parts of the daily offices. The name (Syr. ktābā da-qdām wad-bāthar ‘book of before and after’) comes from one section of the book which gives the šuraye (variable Psalms) before and after Ps. 140 at the evening service ( ramšā ). In alternate weeks, one or the other of the two choirs begins the service. Thus the weeks are also styled weeks ‘before’ and weeks ‘after’. In spite of its practical importance, mss. of the Qdām w-Bāthar were always rare. It was first edited in print by P. Bedjan as part of the Breviarium Chaldaicum (Paris 1886), 341*–398*. The Ch. of E. uses a Mosul edition of 1923 (reprinting that of Urmia 1892) or the printed Ḥudrā (pp. 1–110 of each volume). The editions vary in content. Sources A. J. Maclean, East Syrian daily offices (1894). ( ET ) J. Mateos, Lelya-ṣapra ( OCA 156; 1959), 32–7. James F. Coakley",
