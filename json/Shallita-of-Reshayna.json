(8th cent. ?) [Ch. of E.] Bp. of Reshʿayna and author of liturgical texts. Nothing is known of his life, and his dates are uncertain. The ‘Catalogue’ of ʿAbdishoʿ (ch. 109) attributes to him various liturgical compositions. Best attested are the long prose prayers in a learned style incorporated into the liturgical collection known as the Abū Ḥalīm (after its compiler, Patr. Eliya III [1176–90]). A considerable number of these are to be found in T. Darmo’s edition of the Ḥudrā (vol. I has 17, vol. II has 12). The Shaliṭa who sometimes features in ‘Charms’ ( e.g. e.g., Gollancz’s ms. A) will be Mar Awgen ’s disciple, Shaliṭa , and not the bp. Sources Baumstark, Literatur , 213, 358. Sebastian P. Brock",
