(d. 1389) [ Syr. Orth. ] First Patr. patr. of Ṭur ʿAbdin . Little is known about his life. While he was bp. of Ṣalaḥ under the honorific name Baselios, Patr. Ishmaʿil (d. 1365) hastily excommunicated him. Sobo traveled to Dayr al-Zaʿfarān , to seek reconciliation with the Patr. patr. , but the latter refused to receive him. Sobo made a second attempt, this time accompanied by a delegation of bishops, priests, and notables from Ṭur ʿAbdin, but the Patr. patr. even refused to admit them to the monastery. After a wait of four days outside the doors of the monastery, the delegation left angrily shouting in defiance, ‘oksios, oksios, oksios to Patr. Mor Sobo.’ They went to Dayro d-Mor Yaʿqub of Ṣalaḥ and installed Sobo Patr. patr. of Ṭur ʿAbdin. Sobo received a diploma confirming his Patriarchate from the Ayyubid ruler of Ḥesno d-Kifo dated 6 Aug. 1364. Sources Dolabani, Patriarchen , 182–3.
