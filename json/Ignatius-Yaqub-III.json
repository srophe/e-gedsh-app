He transferred the patriarchate from Ḥimṣ to Damascus . Under his patriarchate, the diocesan map of the church changed as a result of continuous migration to the West.

In 1960, during a visit to NJ, he recorded the entire Beth Gazo , the W.-Syr. musical reference, on reel tapes. He composed a collection of Syriac poems published under the title Mimre mgabayo (Aleppo, 1959).
