Originally from Adiabene , ʿEnanishoʿ was a student at the School of Nisibis with his brother Ishoʿyahb (later Bp. bp. of Shenna) and with Ishoʿyahb III ( Cath. cath. 649–59) before becoming a monk at the Monastery of Mt. Izla. After traveling to Palestine and sojourning in Egyptian Scetis, ʿEnanishoʿ settled in the Monastery of Beth ʿAbe . During his travels he became enamored with Egyptian monasticism and well acquainted with Greek texts. At Beth ʿAbe, he wrote a book on philosophical ‘definitions and divisions’, a lexical tool explicating difficult terms in patristic texts, and a ‘Book of Rules for Homographs’ ( Liber canonum de aequilitteris ), on words having the same consonants but different pronunciations and meanings. With Ishoʿyahb III he collaborated in revising the Ḥudrā , the service book for the ecclesiastical year used by the Ch. of E. Cath. Gewargis I ( ca. 660–80\/1) commissioned ʿEnanishoʿ to prepare the work for which he is most famous, the ‘Paradise of the Fathers’, a massive Syriac compilation incorporating Palladius’s ‘Lausiac History’, the ‘History of the Monks in Egypt’, and numerous apophthegmata of the ascetic Fathers. The ‘Paradise’ became a standard resource for ascetic spirituality in the Ch. of E. A commentary on it was written by Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya (late 7th cent. ). Sources P.
