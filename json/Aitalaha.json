(first half of 4th cent. ) Bp. of Edessa (324\/5–345\/6). A short work in Armenian is transmitted under his name and the editor described it as being addressed ‘to the Christians in the region of Persia, on Faith’. Although it has been claimed (by de Durand) that the original was Greek (and the work is listed in CPG 3340), it is almost certainly a translation from Syriac. The theological phraseology makes it very unlikely that the work really belongs to the first half of the 4th cent. (thus Bruns), and it would best fit sometime between 410 and 428 (thus Bundy).
