Orth. ] Bp. and learned author. Shortly before his death Patr. Athanasios II asked bp. Bp. Sargis Zakunoyo to ordain Giwargi bishop of the Arab tribes, which he did in Nov. 686. As a protegé of Athanasios II and a friend of Yaʿqub of Edessa , he belonged to a line of learned scholars associated with the Monastery of Qenneshre . On Yaʿqub’s death in 708 Giwargi completed the final book 7 of his commentary on the Six Days of Creation. Several of his works concern Greek philosophy, and he revised earlier translations of Aristotle ’s ‘Categories’, ‘On Interpetation Interpretation ’, and ‘Prior Analytics’ ( ed. G. Furlani); this is preserved in the 8th\/9th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,659, together with introductions and glosses. A number of verse texts are attributed to him: on the Patr. Severus , the monastic life, the Myron (sometimes attributed to Yaʿqub of Serug ), Palm Sunday, the Forty Martyrs, and the Burial of Bishops (the last two remain unpublished). His 11 letters cover a wide range of topics, including philosophy, astronomy, theology, and literary criticism; he also wrote a short commentary on baptism and eucharist.
