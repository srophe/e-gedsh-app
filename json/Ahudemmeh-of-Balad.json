(d. 575) [ Syr. Orth. ] Metropolitan ‘of the East’, known as the Apostle of the Arabs. Originating from Balad , he became first bp. of Beth ʿArbaye , and was subsequently consecrated as Metropolitan of the East by Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo (in 559). He undertook much missionary work, and it was due to his conversion of a son of Khusrau I that he was eventually put to death (2 Aug. 575).
