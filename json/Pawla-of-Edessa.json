(early 7th cent. ) [ Syr. Orth. ] Metropolitan of Edessa and translator. His careful revision of an earlier translation of Gregory of Nazianzus ’s Discourses survives complete; this was done while he was in Cyprus in 623\/4, during the Persian invasion and occupation of Mesopotamia. Another large undertaking while he was in Cyprus was the translation of a collection of hymns ( maʿnyoto ) by Severus ‘according to the tradition of Qenneshre ’, that was later to be revised by Yaʿqub of Edessa ( ed. E. W. Brooks, in PO 6.1, 7.5; 1910–11). He is probably also the ‘Abbas Pawla’ who translated the pericope John 7:50–8:12, absent from the Peshitta and Ḥarqlean . He is commemorated in one liturgical calendar ( PO 10, 124) on 23 Aug. (‘Pawla, bp. of Edessa, who translated the books’). Sources S.
