Athanasios became a monk at Dayr al-Zaʿfarān ca. 1697 and was ordained priest before 1705. After he studied under Maph. Shemʿun II , Athanasios was consecrated in 1707 as assisting bp. for the patriarchate (in other accounts bp. of Aleppo ) and was given the honorific name Athanasios. In 1714, he was appointed bp. of Amid. Athanasios died in 1741; it is said that healing miracles took place on his tomb. He was a skilful scribe. Athanasios translated into Arabic a number of works including ḥusoye , Mushe bar Kipho ’s ‘Expositions of the Sacraments’, and two of Shemʿun II’s books, one on theology and the other on the sacraments. He composed a few sermons in Arabic. Sources A.  Barsaum, PatMagJer 5 (1938), 142–3. George A. Kiraz",
