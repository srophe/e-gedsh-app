Orth. [ Syr. Orth. ] Author of a long letter, in twelve sections, addressed to his friend Leon of Ḥarran , synkellos of the Chalcedonian bp. of Ḥarran , in which he gives reasons why he left the Melkite Church for the Syr. Orth. Nothing else is known of his identity or life; since he quotes a work of 743 by John of Damascus , he must have been writing after that date. The letter survives in a single ms. of the 9th\/10th cent. (now divided between Rome, Vat. Syr. 145, and London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,197).
