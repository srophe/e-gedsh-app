The term Nestorianism refers to the idea, allegedly taught by Nestorius , that in the incarnate Christ the Son of God and the son of Mary represent two separate subjects. In western scholarship the term has often misleadingly and incorrectly been used to describe the teaching of the Ch. of E. In the christological controversies that followed the Council of Chalcedon (451) ‘Nestorian’ was used as a polemical term to brand as heretical any who held a strict dyophysite position (miaphysites indeed used it of all dyophysites). After the Arab conquests the label came to be employed solely for the Ch Ch. of E., and this usage has unfortunately been taken over in much western writing. See also Ecumenical Dialogue .
