(6th\/7th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] Monastic author. According to the Khuzistan Chronicle there was rivalry between him and Babai the Great , as a result of which he was known as ‘Babai the Small’. His authorship of a monastic ‘ Letter to Cyriacus ’, transmitted in W.-Syr. mss. and attributed to ‘Babai whom the wicked Barṣawma Barṣawma slew’ ( i.e. i.e., the Cath. Babowai, 457–84), is confirmed by a quotation, attributed to him, in Dadishoʿ ’s ‘ Commentary on Abba Isaiah ’ (13:18). He was also author of some memre , one being ‘On the final evil hour’ (of which a fragment in Sogdian translation also survives), and at least one Tešboḥtā (which is also found in the Maronite Weekday Office).
