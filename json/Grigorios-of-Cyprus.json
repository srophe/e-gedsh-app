(6th\/7th cent. ) [Ch. of the E] Monastic author. Very little is known of this Persian monk from Susiana, and earlier scholars wrongly identified him as a contemporary of Epiphanius (d. 403), since one of the three monastic letters he wrote is addressed to a disciple of that name. Grigorios evidently spent some time in Cyprus, before returning to a monastery on Mount Izla. Besides the three letters, he also wrote a ‘Treatise on the Monastic Life’ in seven books, of which only the last one, entitled ‘On holy theoria , which is translated “divine vision” in Syriac’, has so far been published (with LT ). His work is also transmitted in Syr. Orth. mss. Sources I. Hausherr, Gregorii Monachi Cyprii de Theoria Sancta ( OCA 110; 1937). (Syr. with LT ) J. Kirchmeyer, in DSpir , vol. 6 (1967), 920–2.
