(late 6th or 7th cent. ) The Acts of Mari, which date from the late 6th or 7th  cent., provide an account of the earliest preaching of the Gospel in the Parthian\/Persian Empire. Mari, a disciple of Addai, is sent to preach in ‘the region of Babel’; starting from Edessa his travels are said to have taken him to Nisibis , Arzanene, Beth Zabdai, Beth ʿArbaye , Arbela , Athor, and Nineveh , continuing on southwards to Beth Garmai , Beth Aramaye , Seleucia-Ctesiphon , ending up in Dayra d-Qunni, where he died. Very probably the Acts of Mari were produced in the Dayra d-Qunni, which became famous in the early Islamic period. It is possible that the account of Mari’s travels was also intended to act as a counterpart to that of the missionary travels of Mani . Other sources on Mari, notably Bar ʿEbroyo (Ecclesiastical History II, 3) and the ‘Book of the Tower’, limit Mari’s preaching to Babylonia. The Acts, which clearly know the ‘ Teaching of Addai ’, are probably the earliest source to refer to the impression of Christ’s face left on a cloth ( sindon , the term also found in the Greek Acts of Thaddaeus, whose date is disputed; in the Teaching of Addai his portrait is painted).
