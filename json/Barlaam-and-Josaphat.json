A hagiographic tale of Indian (Buddhist) origin which was subsequently christianized (Bodisatva becomes Josaphat). Although the Greek text ( CPG 8120) is traditionally ascribed to John of Damascus , it is now considered to have been translated by Euthymius the Athonite (d. 1028) from Georgian, which in turn derived from an Ismaili form of the story ( FT by D. Gimaret, 1971). Although the story has been translated into many different languages, it appears that no Syriac version ever existed; nevertheless, it has two separate links with Syriac: chapter 27, a discourse by the ascetic Nachor, for the most part reuses the Apology of Aristides , whose Greek original is otherwise almost entirely lost, but which survives in Syriac (and Armenian) translation; and secondly, two parables from the tale did find their way into Syriac, one of which was incorporated by Bar ʿEbroyo into his ‘Amusing stories’ (10, no. 382).
