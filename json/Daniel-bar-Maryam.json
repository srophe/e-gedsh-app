(7th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] Author of an ‘Ecclesiastical history’. He was a contemporary of Ishoʿyahb III (d. 659). His work does not survive, but various authors refer to it, in particular Timotheos I , Pseudo-Gewargis of Arbela , and Ishoʿdad of Merv (in his commentary on John). In addition, it is explicitly quoted 5 times in the Arabic Chronicle of Siirt , which has led scholars to suggest that it was used as a direct source by the Chronicler chronicler (along with two other 7th-cent. historians whose works have not been preserved, Eliya of Merv and Bar Sahde). Daniel’s Ecclesiastical History is mentioned by ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha , along with a work dealing with chronology (which is not otherwise known). Perhaps Daniel bar Maryam is the same person as Daniel bar Ṭubanitha . Sources E.  Degen, ‘Daniel bar Maryam.
