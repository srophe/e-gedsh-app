Abbot of the Monastery of Sinai around the year 600. Climacus ( klimakos ) means ‘of the Ladder’, after the title of an important spiritual treatise in which he describes the monk’s ascent to God as a ladder of thirty steps, each step being a particular stage of the spiritual life. The work was originally composed in Greek and enjoyed great popularity in the Byzantine tradition. A Syriac translation originated in Melk. circles, but was in the East mostly read in Arabic. In the W.-Syr. tradition this Melk. Syriac version ( ktābā d-massqāne ) remained virtually unknown until Bar ʿEbroyo (d. 1286) inserted important fragments into his ‘Ethicon’ and the ‘Book of the Dove’. Sources CPG 7850–7853.
