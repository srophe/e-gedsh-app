A collection of Syriac sentences attributed to ‘Menander the Wise’, probably the Greek comedian (d. 292\/1 BC) under whose name circulated Greek monostichs ( ed. Jaekel), many of which were not original to Menander. The Syriac sentences are preserved in the 7th-cent. ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,658 ( ed. Land; corrections by Wright) which contains also various philosophical treatises and gnomologia (cf. Wright, Catalogue … British Museum , vol. 3, 1154–60). An epitome of the collection exists in London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,614 ( ed. Sachau). Scholars have differently divided the collection into individual sayings, ranging in number from 96 (Audet) to 153 (Baumstark; Schulthess has 101, Riessler 103). More recently, the sayings have been cited according to line number (Baarda counts 474 lines). The literary form of the sentences varies: there are indicative and imperative maxims as well as longer sections of moral advice. Noteworthy is the dialogue scene between Homer and his friends ( ed. Land, 66.8–15; tr. Baarda, lines 78–93). The Syriac sentences of Menander are addressed to a well-situated man of the upper class of society. They contain practical advice on how to live a happy, prosperous, and peaceful life, addressing themes such as the fear of God, respect for parents and elders, raising of children, choice of a wife, moderate consumption of food and drink, treatment of servants, warnings not to commit adultery, proper behavior as a guest, and friendship. The thematic structure of the Syriac Menander is loose; Kirk has argued that the collection is organized along the major stages of a life, from birth through adulthood and old age to death. The Syriac text probably is a translation from the Greek (Land; Baumstark, 473f.; Schulthess, 201; Küchler, 316; Baarda, 584), the original of which is no longer extant. Frankenberg’s thesis of a Hebrew original has been widely rejected. The question of the author’s cultural context is still being debated: the Syriac Menander bears resemblances both to Jewish wisdom literature (especially Proverbs, Jesus Sirach, Aḥiqar , Pseudo-Phocylides) and to Greek wisdom traditions (some Syriac sentences have a parallel in the Greek monostichs); the Syriac collection thus is part of an ‘international wisdom tradition’ (Schulthess, 201). Several earlier scholars stressed the Greek affinities (Renan, Land, Baumstark, Schulthess), whereas others argued for a Jewish authorship (Frankenberg, Riessler, Kirk). Problematic for a Jewish authorship remains a passage which warns against table fellowship with (pagan) priests (Land, 69,17–24; tr. Baarda, lines 262–77), implying a polytheistic background of the author. The text’s classification as a Jewish pseudepigraphon has been challenged (Schmid and Stählin, 623; Schürer, 693), but has recently been upheld by Baarda and Kirk. Audet argued for an Egyptian provenance; his thesis was followed by Küchler, but rejected by Baarda. Concerning the date of composition, there is a consensus that the sentences date to the Roman period. An allusion to the law that a master may not kill his slave (Land, 67,21f.; tr. Baarda, line 159), first stipulated by Hadrian, suggests a date after the middle of the 1st cent. A reference to the schools of gladiators (Land, 65,13–15; tr. Baarda lines 34–33) implies as terminus ante quem ca. 400, since after Constantine’s legislation against gladiatorial games in 325 (Cod. Theod. 15.12.1) the schools gradually disappeared (cf. Audet, 77f.). Moreover, a reference to crucifixion as punishment for theft (Land, 70,8; tr. Baarda line 295) suggests a date before Constantine’s prohibition of this form of punishment. Hence most scholars date the collection to the 3rd cent. However, the date of the Syriac translation remains uncertain.
