(1021-5) and bp. of Beth Nuhadra; exegete of the School of Mar Mari . (d. 1025) [Ch. of E.] Cath. (1021–5) and formerly bp. of Beth Nuhadra , and exegete of the School of Mar Mari. His election was disputed and a letter by Eliya of Nisibis on the subject survives ( ed. B. Vandenhoff, in OC 11 [1913]). Ishoʿyahb has been identified (by van Unnik) as the author of a series of 123 Questions and Answers on the Eucharist attributed in the mss. to Ishoʿyahb the Great ( i.e. i.e., III). Neither ʿAbdishoʿ in his ‘Catalogue’, nor any other ancient source, attributes any works to Ishoʿyahb IV.
