He was consecrated bp. of Dayro d-Mor Abay with the unusual Syriac, rather than Greek, honorific title Isḥoq. He may have participated in the installation of the anti-patriarch Shemʿun of Maʿdan ca. 1699. After his death in 1730, the diocese of Mor Abay, which then included Ṣawro, Qilleth, and its villages, Bafawah, ʿWein, Kharbah and Maʿsarteh, became part of the diocese of Mardin .
