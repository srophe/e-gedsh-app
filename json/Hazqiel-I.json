Yawsep. (d. 580\/1) [Ch. of E.] Cath. since 567 or 570, as successor of the deposed Cath. Yawsep . ʿAmr lists Ḥazqiel among the disciples of Aba  I (Labourt 169, note 3). An important synod was held in 576, the report and canons of which are preserved in the Synodicon Orientale . Some of the phraseology in the Christological passages of the report (‘Christ who is in the flesh, who is known and confessed in two natures , God and Man, a single Son …’ seems to echo the wording of the definition of the Council of Chalcedon (451). The first among the 39 canons addresses the problem of the ‘Messalians’; with their actions against deceitful monks, the bps. may have tried to stop the missionary work undertaken in these years by the Miaphysites (see Aḥudemmeh of Balad ). Most of the other canons are of a disciplinary and a general cultural nature, such as no. 37, barring Christian girls from studying secular music. Sources Braun, Synodicon Orientale , 163–90.
