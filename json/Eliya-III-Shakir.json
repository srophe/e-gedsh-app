(1917-32), and a local saint in Malankara. (1867–1932) [ Syr. Orth. ] Patr. (1917–32), and a local saint in Malankara. The son of a priest, he was born in Mardin and christened Naṣri. He worked as a shoemaker during his teens, then joined Dayr al-Zaʿfarān in 1887. He became a monk in 1889 upon which he was renamed Eliya. He was ordained priest in 1892, and consecrated bp. of Amid in 1908. In 1912, he was transferred to Mosul where he served until his election to the patriarchate in 1917. He held the Dayro d-Mor Matay Synod in 1930. At the invitation of Lord Irwin, the British Viceroy to India, and appeals from the local clergy, Eliya visited Malankara in 1931 to resolve the dispute there, but died before completing his mission. He was buried outside of the Church of Mor Sṭephanos. Later, Dayro d-Mor Ignatius was built on the burial site. His tomb has become a pilgrimage center. At the recommendation of the local Malankara Synod, Patr. Zakka I issued a bull in 1987 granting permission to add Eliya’s name to the 5th Diptych, after the name of Mor Adai, along with the names of Maph. Yaldo and Bp. Gregorios of Parumala, effectively declaring him a local saint. This bull is published in PatMagDam 26 (1988), 66–72; the corresponding bull bears no. E 265\/87. His feast day is 13 Feb.
