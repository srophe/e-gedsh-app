(7th cent. ) [Ch. of E.] Author of an abbreviated Commentary on the Liturgy . Virtually nothing is known of his life. It is presumed that he was some relation of Gabriel bar Lipeh (better known as Gabriel Qaṭraya ), and it is likely that he belongs to the 7th cent. Abraham’s liturgical commentary turns out to be very largely just an abbreviation of that by Gabriel. He is often cited by name in the Anonymous Commentary wrongly attributed to Gewargis of Arbela .
