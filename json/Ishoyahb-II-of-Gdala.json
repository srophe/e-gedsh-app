(d. ca. 646) [Ch. of E.] Cath. (628–45) and author. Originating from Gdala (in Beth ʿArbaye ), he evidently studied at the School of Nisibis , and was one of the group who left the School ca. 597 in protest against the teaching of the director, Ḥenana of Adiabene . According to the Khuzistan Chronicle he had married ‘in his youth’, but nevertheless was appointed bp. of Balad (whether or not as a widower is unclear), before becoming Cath. cath. In 630 he was sent by Queen Boran on an embassy to Heraclius, together with the future Ishoʿyahb III and Sahdona ; the meeting with the Byzantine emperor took place in Aleppo . Although late sources claim he corresponded with Muḥammad and met ʿUmar, in fact he appears to have left Seleucia-Ctesiphon when the city was taken by the Arabs in 637\/8 and withdrawn to Karka in Beth Garmai . His only surviving writings are: a long letter to Rabban Abraham of Beth Madaye on christology ( ed. Sako, with FT ), a profession of faith (preserved only in Arabic; text and tr. in Sako, 59–60), and the tešboḥtā ‘Our father in heaven, holy in his nature ...’, which is also attributed in some mss. to Babai the Great . The Chronicle of Siirt provides a Letter in reply to Barṣawma, bp. of Susa, who had accused Ishoʿyahb of compromising the christological position of the Ch. of E. when he met Heraclius; according to Sako, however, this is not genuine.
