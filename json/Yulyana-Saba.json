Julian Saba (d. 377) An ascetic living in the region of Edessa . Little is known of his life apart from the fact that he made a pilgrimage to Sinai (probably in 362); he is also said to have visited Antioch . The year of his death is given in the Chronicle of Edessa . A collection of 24 madroše on him are attributed to Ephrem , of which the first four are probably genuinely by him. Yulyana features in Theodoret ’s ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ (ch. 2), and this circulated separately in Syriac translation ( ed. Bedjan, AMS , vol. VI, 380–404); he was also the subject of a mimro by Yaʿqub of Serugh (unpublished). Sources S. H.  Griffith, ‘Julian Saba, “the Father of the monks of Syria” ’, JECS 2 (1994), 185–216.
