(8th cent. ) [ Syr. Orth. ] A ‘Letter’ attributed to ‘Sargis the Stylite of Gusit’ (near Ḥimṣ ) ‘against a Jew who argued that God has no son, and that God has not begotten’ is preserved in a single ms. of the 8th\/9th cent. According to its editor the work must belong to the 8th cent. (and not the late 6th, as had earlier been suggested). It is a literary work based on several sources, among them a collection of testimonia; there is also a section on images (of interest in view of the date). In part the work may also be based on an actual discussion with a Jew. Sources A. P.  Hayman, The Disputation of Sergius the Stylite against a Jew ( CSCO 338–9; 1973).
