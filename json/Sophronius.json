(d. 638) Patr. of Jerusalem (from 634) and Greek author. Together with Maximus the Confessor he was a strong opponent of the monoergist and monothelete theology promoted by the emperor Heraclius. His Letter to Arcadius, archbishop of Cyprus, lost in Greek, was translated in Edessa by a certain Constantine in 720\/1, and is preserved in a single Syriac ms. dated 723. This and his Synodical Letter of 634 are his only dogmatic writings, his other works consisting of sermons, hagiography, and poetry. His death fell shortly after the peaceful transfer of Jerusalem to Arab rule. Sources CPG 7635–7681. M.  Albert, Lettre de Sophrone de Jérusalem à Arcadius de Chypre ( PO 39.2; 1978).
