Ruins near the present agglomeration mark the site of an abandoned village with a small church known as the Chapel of Saydat Kharāʾib (Our Lady of the Ruins). A fire caused the half-dome of the apse to be covered with a layer of soot, hiding a depiction of the Deisis Vision. The nave’s fragmented decoration consists of a tonsured St. Domatius on the north wall, and a fragmented Nativity scene opposite him. The estimated date of these murals is the first half of the 13th cent. Sources M. Immerzeel, Identity Puzzles. Medieval Christian Art in Syria and Lebanon ( OLA 184; 2009), 99. L.
