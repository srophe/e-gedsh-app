(d. 979) [Ch. of E.] Monk and spiritual teacher. Born in Beth ʿEdraye, near Mosul , he became a monk of the Monastery of Rabban Hormizd , but subsequently moved to the monastery of Abraham, of Beth Ṣayyare (in the ʿAmadiyya region, N. Iraq). His Life was written by his disciple Yoḥannan bar Kaldun; this not only incorporates much of his spiritual teaching (in chapter 8), but it also gives a detailed picture of monastic life of the time.
