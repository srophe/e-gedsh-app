During World War II, he worked as an interpreter for the British Government for the Assyrians who were then deported from Iraq. After the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, Barsoum became a refugee for the third time and lived in Bethlehem. In 1955 he immigrated to Jordan and in 1966 to the USA. In 1984, he went on a pilgrimage to his homeland Ṭur ʿAbdin with Athanasios Yeshuʿ Samuel . He died in Los Angeles in 1996.
