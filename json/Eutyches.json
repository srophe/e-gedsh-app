In Nov. 448 Eusebius bp. of Dorylaeum denounced his teaching to Patr. Flavian, and Eutyches was summoned to a synod which condemned him ( Pseudo-Zacharias , ‘Church History’, II.2; Acts of Council of Chalcedon, First Session). He appealed to Pope Leo I ( CPG 5948) and to Dioscorus, presenting professions of faith in formulations that were considered acceptable (Leo’s reply also survives [ CPG 5953]). He was restored at the second Council of Ephesus (449), but under the new emperor Marcian he was condemned again at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and this time exiled. Exactly what his teaching really was is unclear (both at the time and today), but he was understood to have held that Christ is consubstantial only with the Father, and not with us — a position rejected by both miaphysites and dyophysites.
